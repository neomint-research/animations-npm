* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/neomint-research/animations-npm/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/neomint-research/animations-npm/issues). Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
