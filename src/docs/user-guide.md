## Getting Started with Themes

### What Are Themes?
Think of themes as the "personality" of your animations. Just like choosing an outfit sets the mood for your day, choosing a theme sets the visual mood for your website. Each theme has its own unique style, colors, and movement patterns.

### Choosing Your First Theme
It's like picking a filter for your photos - each theme creates a different atmosphere:

```jsx
// Try this: Start with Cyberpunk for a bold, futuristic look
<DataNetwork theme="cyberpunk" />

// Or this: Choose Organic for a natural, flowing feel
<DataNetwork theme="organic" />
```

### Basic Customization Concepts
You don't need to understand code to customize NEOMINT. Think of it like adjusting sliders on a photo editor:
- **Theme** = Overall style (like choosing a filter)
- **Performance** = Animation smoothness (like video quality settings)
- **Accessibility** = Making it comfortable for everyone (like adding subtitles)

**Visual characteristics**:
- Green-on-black color scheme
- Vertical flowing patterns
- Binary and code-like elements
- Grid-based organization

#### üî∑ **Geometric Theme**

### Color Customization Basics
While each theme has its signature colors, you can fine-tune them to match your brand:

```jsx
// Try this: Keep the theme's style but adjust its intensity
<DataNetwork 
  theme="cyberpunk"
  style={{ opacity: 0.8 }}  // Softer neon glow
/>

// Or this: Layer it behind your content
<DataNetwork 
  theme="quantum"
  style={{ 
    position: 'absolute',
    zIndex: -1,
    opacity: 0.6 
  }}
/>
```

## Performance & Device Settings

### Simple Performance Explanations

Think of performance modes like choosing video quality on YouTube:

#### üîã **Eco Mode** 
**Like**: Watching videos on "Data Saver"
- Fewer moving parts
- Longer battery life on phones
- Best for: Mobile users, older devices

```jsx
// Try this for mobile-friendly animations
<DataNetwork performance="eco" />
```

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced Mode** (Default)
**Like**: "Auto" quality that adjusts to your connection
- Smart mix of beauty and performance
- Works well everywhere
- Best for: Most websites and users

```jsx
// This is already the default, but you can explicitly set it
<DataNetwork performance="balanced" />
```

#### üöÄ **Performance Mode**
**Like**: Watching in 4K with all effects on
- Maximum visual impact
- All effects enabled
- Best for: Desktop users, gaming rigs, showcases

```jsx
// Try this for maximum visual impact
<DataNetwork performance="performance" />
```

### Device-Specific Recommendations

**For Mobile Sites**: Use eco mode with reduced particle count
```jsx
<DataNetwork 
  performance="eco"
  nodes={30}  // Fewer particles = smoother on phones
/>
```

**For Desktop Showcases**: Go all out with performance mode
```jsx
<DataNetwork 
  performance="performance"
  nodes={100}  // More particles for bigger screens
/>
```

**For Mixed Audiences**: Stick with balanced (it auto-adjusts!)
```jsx
<DataNetwork />  // Smart defaults handle everything
```

## Accessibility Configuration

Making your animations comfortable for everyone is like adjusting the volume on your TV - it should work for all your viewers.

### Reduced Motion for Comfort
Some people get dizzy from too much movement (like motion sickness). Here's how to be considerate:

```jsx
// Try this: Gentle animations that won't cause discomfort
<DataNetwork 
  reducedMotion={true}  // Calmer, slower movements
/>
```

### High Contrast Options
Like turning up the brightness on your phone in sunlight:

```jsx
// Try this: Better visibility for all lighting conditions
<DataNetwork 
  theme="matrix"  // Already high contrast
  style={{ filter: 'contrast(1.2)' }}  // Even more contrast
/>
```

### Focus Indicators
Help keyboard users navigate (like highlighting menu items on a TV):

```jsx
// Try this: Clear focus states for navigation
<DataNetwork 
  interactive={true}
  className="focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-blue-500"
/>
```

## Need More Help?

Remember, the best animation is one that enhances your content without overwhelming it. Start simple, experiment with different themes, and adjust based on how it feels. Your visitors will appreciate the thoughtful touches!

### Golden Rules:
1. **Less is often more** - Start with lower opacity and fewer particles
2. **Test on phones** - What looks great on desktop might be too much on mobile
3. **Ask for feedback** - Show it to friends and see what they think
4. **Have fun!** - These animations are meant to bring joy to your site

Happy animating! üé®‚ú®
