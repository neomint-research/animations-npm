# Animation Prompts - Natural Language Interface

Transform your ideas into stunning animations using simple, everyday language. No coding required - just describe what you want to see.

## How to Use Animation Prompts

Getting started is simple! Just tell the AI what kind of animation you want using natural language. Here's the basic format:

- Be specific about the feeling you want to convey
- Mention where the animation will be used
- Describe the motion in everyday terms
- Combine multiple prompts for complex effects
